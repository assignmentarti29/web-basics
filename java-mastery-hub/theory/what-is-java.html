            <h2>🎯 Introduction to Java</h2>

            <h3>Level 1: Beginner-Friendly Explanation (Like Explaining to a Baby)</h3>
            <p>
                Imagine you have a magic toy that can work in ANY playroom - your friend's house, grandma's house, or
                even at school.
                You don't need different toys for different places - this ONE toy works everywhere!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Java</strong> is like that magic toy, but for computers. It's a special language that lets you
                write instructions
                for computers, and those instructions can work on ANY computer - Windows, Mac, phones, tablets, even
                smart TVs!
                You write it once, and it works everywhere. That's the magic of Java! ✨
            </p>

                <div class="callout-title">📝 NOTE</div>
                <p>Java is named after Java coffee ☕, which the creators loved to drink while programming!</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Level 2: Real-World Analogy</h3>
            <p>
                Think of Java as a <strong>universal translator</strong> like in science fiction movies. When people
                from different
                countries meet, they need a common language to communicate. Similarly, different computers (Windows,
                Mac, Linux, Android)
                are like different countries speaking different languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Java acts as that universal translator. When you write a program in Java, it doesn't speak directly to
                Windows or Mac.
                Instead, it speaks to a special "translator" called the <strong>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</strong>,
                which then translates
                your instructions to whatever computer you're using. This is why the same Java program can run on your
                Windows laptop,
                your friend's Mac, and your Android phone without any changes!
            </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Minecraft</strong> is written in Java! That's why you can play Minecraft on Windows, Mac,
                    Linux, and many other platforms.
                    The game developers wrote it once in Java, and it runs everywhere. That's the power of "Write Once,
                    Run Anywhere"!
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Level 3: Technical Deep-Dive</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Java</strong> is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language
                developed by Sun Microsystems
                (now owned by Oracle Corporation). It follows the principle of <strong>WORA (Write Once, Run
                    Anywhere)</strong>, meaning compiled
                Java code can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) without the need for
                recompilation.
            </p>

            <h4>Key Characteristics of Java:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Object-Oriented</strong>: Everything in Java is an object with properties and behaviors</li>
                <li><strong>Platform-Independent</strong>: Bytecode runs on any platform with JVM</li>
                <li><strong>Robust</strong>: Strong memory management, exception handling, and type checking</li>
                <li><strong>Secure</strong>: No explicit pointers, runs inside JVM sandbox</li>
                <li><strong>Multithreaded</strong>: Built-in support for concurrent programming</li>
                <li><strong>Architecture-Neutral</strong>: Bytecode is not specific to any processor architecture</li>
                <li><strong>High Performance</strong>: Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation improves execution speed</li>
                <li><strong>Distributed</strong>: Designed for networked/distributed environments</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout tip">
                <div class="callout-title">💡 TIP - Interview Perspective</div>
                <p>
                    When asked "What is Java?", don't just say "a programming language." Say: <strong>"Java is a
                        high-level, object-oriented,
                        platform-independent programming language that follows the WORA principle through the use of
                        bytecode and JVM."</strong>
                    This shows deeper understanding!

        <!-- Section 2: History and Origins of Java -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>📜 History and Origins of Java</h2>

            <h3>Level 1: Beginner-Friendly Explanation</h3>
            <p>
                A long time ago (in 1991), some smart people at a company called Sun Microsystems wanted to create a
                language that could
                control TVs, toasters, and other home devices. They called it "Oak" (named after a tree outside their
                office window).
            </p>
            <p>
                But then the internet became popular! They realized their language would be PERFECT for the internet
                because it could run
                on any computer. So they renamed it "Java" and released it in 1995. People LOVED it, and it became super
                popular!
            </p>

            <h3>Level 2: Real-World Context</h3>
            <p>
                In the early 1990s, the tech world was fragmented. Programs written for Windows wouldn't work on Mac,
                and vice versa.
                This was a huge problem for developers who had to write the same program multiple times for different
                systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems saw this problem and created Java with one revolutionary
                goal:
                <strong>"Write Once, Run Anywhere."</strong> Initially designed for interactive television and consumer
                electronics,
                Java found its true calling with the rise of the internet in the mid-1990s.
            </p>

            <h3>Level 3: Technical History</h3>

            <h4>Timeline of Java Evolution:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1991</strong>: Project "Green" started by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton
                </li>
                <li><strong>1992</strong>: Language initially named "Oak" (later renamed due to trademark issues)</li>
                <li><strong>1995</strong>: Java 1.0 officially released - "Write Once, Run Anywhere"</li>
                <li><strong>1996</strong>: Java 1.1 - Inner classes, JavaBeans, JDBC, RMI</li>
                <li><strong>1998</strong>: Java 2 (J2SE 1.2) - Swing, Collections Framework</li>
                <li><strong>2004</strong>: Java 5 - Generics, Annotations, Enums, Autoboxing</li>
                <li><strong>2006</strong>: Java 6 - Performance improvements, scripting support</li>
                <li><strong>2011</strong>: Java 7 - Try-with-resources, diamond operator</li>
                <li><strong>2014</strong>: Java 8 - Lambda expressions, Stream API, functional programming</li>
                <li><strong>2017</strong>: Java 9 - Module system (Project Jigsaw)</li>
                <li><strong>2018</strong>: Java 10, 11 - Local variable type inference, LTS version</li>
                <li><strong>2021</strong>: Java 17 (LTS) - Sealed classes, pattern matching</li>
                <li><strong>2023+</strong>: Java 21 (LTS) - Virtual threads, pattern matching enhancements</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout note">
                <div class="callout-title">📝 NOTE - LTS Versions</div>
                <p>
                    LTS (Long-Term Support) versions like Java 8, 11, 17, and 21 receive extended support and updates.
                    Most enterprises use LTS versions for production systems due to stability and long-term support
                    guarantees.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4>The "Write Once, Run Anywhere" Philosophy</h4>
            <p>
                Java's core philosophy is platform independence. Unlike C or C++ where you compile code for a specific
                operating system
                (Windows .exe, Linux binary, etc.), Java compiles to an intermediate format called
                <strong>bytecode</strong>. This bytecode
                can run on any system that has a JVM, regardless of the underlying hardware or operating system.
            </p>

            <div class="callout example">
                <div class="callout-title">💡 EXAMPLE - Real-World Impact</div>
                <p>
                    <strong>Android</strong> (the world's most popular mobile OS) is built on Java! When Google needed a
                    language for Android,
                    they chose Java because of its platform independence, security, and robust ecosystem. Today,
                    billions of Android devices
                    run Java-based applications.

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>⚙️ JVM, JRE, and JDK - The Java Ecosystem</h2>

            <p>
                Understanding the relationship between JVM, JRE, and JDK is crucial for every Java developer. Let's
                break them down:
            </p>

            <h3>1. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)</h3>

            <h4>Level 1: Beginner-Friendly Explanation</h4>
            <p>
                Imagine you have a robot that can understand your instructions and do tasks for you. But this robot
                doesn't understand English -
                it only understands a special robot language. The JVM is like that robot! It takes your Java
                instructions (which are translated
                into "bytecode") and makes the computer do what you want.
            </p>

            <h4>Level 2: Real-World Analogy</h4>
            <p>
                Think of JVM as a <strong>virtual computer inside your real computer</strong>. Just like you can run a
                Windows computer inside
                a Mac using virtualization software, JVM creates a "virtual Java computer" that works the same way on
                every real computer.
                This is why Java programs are portable!
            </p>

            <h4>Level 3: Technical Explanation</h4>
            <p>
                The <strong>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</strong> is an abstract computing machine that provides a runtime
                environment to execute
                Java bytecode. It's the core component that enables Java's platform independence. The JVM:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Loads bytecode (.class files)</li>
                <li>Verifies bytecode for security</li>
                <li>Executes bytecode using interpretation or JIT compilation</li>
                <li>Manages memory (heap, stack) and garbage collection</li>
                <li>Provides runtime environment and security</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout note">
                <div class="callout-title">📝 NOTE</div>
                <p>
                    JVM is platform-dependent! There's a different JVM for Windows, Mac, Linux, etc. But they all
                    execute the same bytecode,
                    which is why your Java program is platform-independent.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment)</h3>

            <h4>Level 1: Beginner-Friendly Explanation</h4>
            <p>
                If JVM is the robot, then JRE is the robot plus all the tools and toys it needs to work. It's like a
                complete playset!
                When you want to RUN a Java program (not create one, just run it), you need JRE.
            </p>

            <h4>Level 2: Real-World Analogy</h4>
            <p>
                Think of JRE as a <strong>media player</strong>. Just like you need VLC or Windows Media Player to watch
                videos (but you don't
                need video editing software), you need JRE to run Java programs. It includes the JVM plus all the
                libraries needed to run Java applications.
            </p>

            <h4>Level 3: Technical Explanation</h4>
            <p>
                The <strong>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</strong> is a software package that provides the minimum
                requirements to run Java applications. It includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>JVM</strong> - The execution engine</li>
                <li><strong>Core Libraries</strong> - Java class libraries (java.lang, java.util, java.io, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Supporting Files</strong> - Configuration files, property files</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Important:</strong> JRE is for running Java programs. It does NOT include development tools like
                compilers or debuggers.
            </p>

            <h3>3. JDK (Java Development Kit)</h3>

            <h4>Level 1: Beginner-Friendly Explanation</h4>
            <p>
                JDK is the COMPLETE package! It has everything - the robot (JVM), the playset (JRE), PLUS special tools
                to CREATE new programs.
                It's like having the media player AND the video editing software. If you want to write Java programs,
                you need JDK!
            </p>

            <h4>Level 2: Real-World Analogy</h4>
            <p>
                Think of JDK as a <strong>complete workshop</strong>. If JRE is like having a car to drive, JDK is like
                having a car PLUS all
                the tools to build and repair cars. It includes everything in JRE plus development tools.
            </p>

            <h4>Level 3: Technical Explanation</h4>
            <p>
                The <strong>Java Development Kit (JDK)</strong> is a full-featured software development kit for Java
                developers. It includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>JRE</strong> - Complete runtime environment (which includes JVM)</li>
                <li><strong>javac</strong> - Java compiler (converts .java to .class bytecode)</li>
                <li><strong>java</strong> - Java application launcher</li>
                <li><strong>javadoc</strong> - Documentation generator</li>
                <li><strong>jar</strong> - Archive tool for packaging</li>
                <li><strong>jdb</strong> - Java debugger</li>
                <li><strong>Other tools</strong> - javap (disassembler), jconsole (monitoring), etc.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Section 4: How Java Code Runs -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>🔄 How Java Code Runs - Step by Step</h2>

            <h3>Level 1: Beginner-Friendly Explanation</h3>
            <p>
                When you write a Java program, it's like writing a recipe in English. But computers don't understand
                English! So we need to:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Translate your recipe into a special "computer language" (this is called <strong>compiling</strong>)
                </li>
                <li>Give that special language to the JVM robot</li>
                <li>The JVM robot reads it and makes the computer do what you want!</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Level 2: Real-World Analogy</h3>
            <p>
                Think of it like ordering food at an international restaurant:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>You write your order</strong> in English (Your .java file)</li>
                <li><strong>The waiter translates</strong> it to the chef's language (Compiler creates .class bytecode)
                </li>
                <li><strong>The chef cooks</strong> based on the translated order (JVM executes bytecode)</li>
                <li><strong>You get your food</strong> (Program output)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The beauty? The same translated order (bytecode) works with chefs from different countries (different
                operating systems)!
            </p>

            <h3>Level 3: Technical Execution Flow</h3>

            <h4>Step-by-Step Execution Process:</h4>

            <div
                style="background: var(--bg-hover); border-left: 4px solid var(--accent); padding: var(--spacing-md); margin: var(--spacing-md) 0;">
                <p><strong>Step 1: Write Source Code (.java file)</strong></p>
                <p>Developer writes Java code in a text file with .java extension (e.g., HelloWorld.java)</p>
            </div>

            <div
                style="background: var(--bg-hover); border-left: 4px solid var(--accent); padding: var(--spacing-md); margin: var(--spacing-md) 0;">
                <p><strong>Step 2: Compilation (javac compiler)</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The Java compiler (javac) converts source code into bytecode:
                    <br><code>javac HelloWorld.java</code>
                    <br>This creates HelloWorld.class (bytecode file)
                </p>
            </div>

            <div
                style="background: var(--bg-hover); border-left: 4px solid var(--accent); padding: var(--spacing-md); margin: var(--spacing-md) 0;">
                <p><strong>Step 3: Bytecode (.class file)</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Bytecode is an intermediate, platform-independent code. It's not machine code (0s and 1s for a
                    specific CPU),
                    but a set of instructions for the JVM. This is the key to Java's "Write Once, Run Anywhere"
                    capability.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div
                style="background: var(--bg-hover); border-left: 4px solid var(--accent); padding: var(--spacing-md); margin: var(--spacing-md) 0;">
                <p><strong>Step 4: Class Loader</strong></p>
                <p>
                    JVM's class loader loads the .class file into memory. It also loads all required Java libraries.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div
                style="background: var(--bg-hover); border-left: 4px solid var(--accent); padding: var(--spacing-md); margin: var(--spacing-md) 0;">
                <p><strong>Step 5: Bytecode Verifier</strong></p>
                <p>
                    JVM verifies the bytecode for security and correctness. It ensures:
                    <br>• No illegal type casts
                    <br>• No stack overflow/underflow
                    <br>• No unauthorized memory access
                </p>
            </div>

            <div
                style="background: var(--bg-hover); border-left: 4px solid var(--accent); padding: var(--spacing-md); margin: var(--spacing-md) 0;">
                <p><strong>Step 6: Execution Engine</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The JVM execution engine runs the bytecode using:
                    <br>• <strong>Interpreter:</strong> Executes bytecode line by line (slower)
                    <br>• <strong>JIT Compiler:</strong> Compiles frequently used bytecode to native machine code for
                    faster execution
                </p>
            </div>

            <div
                style="background: var(--bg-hover); border-left: 4px solid var(--accent); padding: var(--spacing-md); margin: var(--spacing-md) 0;">
                <p><strong>Step 7: Runtime</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Program executes, JVM manages:
                    <br>• Memory allocation (heap and stack)
                    <br>• Garbage collection (automatic memory cleanup)
                    <br>• Thread management
                </p>
            </div>

                <div class="callout-title">⚠️ IMPORTANT - Compilation vs Interpretation</div>
                <p>
                    Java is both compiled AND interpreted:
                    <br>• <strong>Compiled:</strong> .java → .class (bytecode) by javac
                    <br>• <strong>Interpreted:</strong> bytecode → execution by JVM
                    <br><br>
                    This hybrid approach gives Java the best of both worlds: platform independence (from bytecode) and
                    performance
                    (from JIT compilation of hot code paths).

            <h2>🚫 When Not to Use Java</h2>

            <p>
                While Java is versatile, it's not always the best choice. Here are scenarios where other languages might
                be better:
            </p>

            <h3>1. Ultra-Low-Level Hardware Programming</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Why not Java:</strong> For device drivers, operating system kernels, or embedded systems with
                severe memory constraints,
                C or C++ are better choices. Java's JVM overhead is too heavy for these use cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Better alternatives:</strong> C, C++, Rust
            </p>

            <h3>2. Quick Scripting and Automation</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Why not Java:</strong> Java requires compilation and has more boilerplate code. For quick
                scripts and automation tasks,
                interpreted languages are faster to write and execute.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Better alternatives:</strong> Python, Bash, PowerShell
            </p>

            <h3>3. High-Performance Gaming Graphics</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Why not Java:</strong> AAA game engines require direct hardware access and maximum performance.
                While Java can do gaming
                (Minecraft!), it's not ideal for graphics-intensive 3D games.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Better alternatives:</strong> C++, C# (Unity), Unreal Engine
            </p>

            <h3>4. Tiny Embedded Systems</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Why not Java:</strong> Microcontrollers with very limited RAM (< 1MB) can't run JVM efficiently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Better alternatives:</strong> C, Assembly
                    </p>

                    <h3>5. Simple Static Websites</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Why not Java:</strong> For simple content websites, Java is overkill. Simpler
                        technologies are more appropriate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Better alternatives:</strong> HTML/CSS/JavaScript, WordPress, Static Site Generators
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            This doesn't mean Java CAN'T do these things - it means other languages are MORE SUITABLE.
                            Choose the right tool for the job!

                            <strong>Java excels at:</strong> Enterprise applications, Android apps, web backends, big
                            data, cloud services, and systems
                            requiring stability, scalability, and long-term maintenance.
