                explanation: "No! You cannot overload methods by changing only the return type. The parameter list (number, type, or order) must differ. Return type alone is not sufficient for overloading."

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "A recursive method is one that calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller sub-problems. It must have a base case to prevent infinite recursion."

                answerIndex: 1,

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Java is strictly pass-by-value. For primitives, a copy of the value is passed. For objects, a copy of the reference (memory address) is passed, not the object itself."
