                    "A container that stores data values",
                    "A method that performs operations",

                answerIndex: 0,
                explanation: "A variable is a container (like a labeled box) that stores data values in memory. It has a name, type, and value."

                ],
                answerIndex: 2,
                explanation: "Variable names can start with letters, $, or _. They cannot start with digits, contain hyphens, or be Java keywords. '_count' is valid."

                id: 3,

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Java convention uses camelCase for variables (e.g., myVariable, studentAge). UPPER_SNAKE_CASE is for constants, PascalCase for classes."

                id: 5,

                ],
                answerIndex: 2,
                explanation: "Variables declared inside a method are local variables with method scope. They exist only within that method and are destroyed when the method completes."

                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Primitive data type values are stored directly on the stack memory. Stack is fast, organized, and used for method execution and local variables."

                id: 7,

                    "Hard disk"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Objects are stored in heap memory. The stack holds the reference (memory address) to the object, but the actual object data is in the heap."
            },
            {
                id: 8,
                question: "Which memory is faster to access?",

                    "Heap memory",
                    "Stack memory",

                    "Depends on the JVM"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Stack memory is faster because it follows LIFO (Last In First Out) structure and is organized. Heap is larger but slower due to dynamic allocation."
            },
            {
                id: 9,
                question: "What happens to stack memory when a method completes execution?",
                options: [
                    "It remains until program ends",
                    "It is automatically cleared",
                    "It causes memory leak",
                    "It moves to heap"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Stack memory is automatically cleared when a method completes. All local variables are destroyed, making stack memory very efficient."
            },
            {
                id: 10,
                question: "How is heap memory cleaned up in Java?",
                options: [
                    "Manually by programmer",
                    "Automatically when method ends",
                    "By garbage collector",
                    "Never cleaned up"
                ],
                answerIndex: 2,
                explanation: "Heap memory is managed by Java's garbage collector, which automatically removes objects that are no longer referenced, preventing memory leaks."
            },

            // Section 3: Primitive Data Types (Questions 11-20)
            {
                id: 11,

                ],
                answerIndex: 2,
                explanation: "Java has 8 primitive data types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, and boolean."
            },

                    "Depends on platform"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "int is always 4 bytes (32 bits) in Java, regardless of platform. This ensures platform independence."
            },

                id: 13,
                question: "Which data type would you use for storing very large whole numbers?",

                ],
                answerIndex: 2,
                explanation: "long is 8 bytes (64 bits) and can store very large whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807."

                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "The default value of a boolean instance variable is false. Numeric types default to 0, and reference types default to null."

                ],
                answerIndex: 2,
                explanation: "Long literals require 'L' or 'l' suffix (e.g., 1000000L). Uppercase 'L' is preferred to avoid confusion with digit '1'."
            },
            {

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "byte is 8 bits and signed, ranging from -128 to 127. It's useful for memory optimization and file I/O operations."

                id: 17,
                question: "Which data type provides the most precision for decimal numbers?",

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "double provides ~15-16 decimal digits of precision (64 bits), while float provides only ~6-7 digits (32 bits). Use double for most decimal calculations."
