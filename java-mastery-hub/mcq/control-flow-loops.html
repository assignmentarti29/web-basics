            {
                id: 1,
                question: "What is the purpose of an if statement in Java?",
                options: [
                    "To repeat code multiple times",
                    "To execute code only when a condition is true",
                    "To define a method",
                    "To declare variables"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "The if statement executes a block of code only when the specified boolean condition evaluates to true. It's used for conditional execution based on runtime conditions."
            },
            {
                id: 2,

                    "A",
                    "B",
                    "A B",
                    "Nothing"
                ],
                answerIndex: 2,
                explanation: "Both 'A' and 'B' will print. The if statement executes 'A' because x > 5 is true. Then 'B' prints because it's outside the if block and always executes."
            },
            {
                id: 3,
                question: "Which operator should be used to compare two values in an if condition?",
                options: [
                    "= (single equals)",
                    "== (double equals)",

                    "=> (arrow)"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Use == (double equals) for comparison. Single equals (=) is for assignment, not comparison. Using = in an if condition will assign the value instead of comparing it, which is usually a bug."
            },

            // Section 2: if-else (Questions 4-6)
            {
                id: 4,

                options: [
                    "if-else is faster",
                    "if-else provides an alternative path when condition is false",
                    "if-else can only be used with numbers",
                    "There is no difference"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "if-else provides two execution paths: one when the condition is true, another when it's false. With just if, nothing happens when the condition is false. if-else ensures exactly one block executes."
            },
            {
                id: 5,
                question: "What will be printed? int age = 15; if (age >= 18) { System.out.println('Adult'); } else { System.out.println('Minor'); }",

                    "Both Adult and Minor",
                    "Nothing"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Minor will be printed because age (15) is not >= 18, so the condition is false. When the if condition is false, the else block executes."
            },
            {
                id: 6,
                question: "Can you have an if statement without an else?",
                options: [
                    "No, else is mandatory",
                    "Yes, else is optional",
                    "Only in methods",
                    "Only with boolean variables"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "The else block is optional. You can have just an if statement. If the condition is false and there's no else, the program simply skips the if block and continues."
            },

            // Section 3: if-else-if Ladder (Questions 7-9)
            {
                id: 7,
                question: "In an if-else-if ladder, what happens after the first true condition is found?",
                options: [
                    "All remaining conditions are still checked",
                    "Execution stops and remaining conditions are skipped",
                    "Only the next condition is checked",
                    "The program terminates"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Once a condition evaluates to true in an if-else-if ladder, its block executes and all remaining conditions are skipped. This is why order matters - put most specific conditions first."
            },
            {
                id: 8,
                question: "What will be printed? int score = 85; if (score >= 60) { System.out.println('D'); } else if (score >= 90) { System.out.println('A'); }",

                    "Both D and A",
                    "Nothing"
                ],
                answerIndex: 0,
                explanation: "Only 'D' will print. Even though score >= 90 would be false, the first condition (score >= 60) is true, so 'D' prints and the else-if is never checked. This shows why order matters!"
            },
            {
                id: 9,
                question: "What is the best practice for ordering conditions in an if-else-if ladder?",
                options: [
                    "Random order doesn't matter",
                    "Most specific to least specific",
                    "Least specific to most specific",
                    "Alphabetical order"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Order from most specific to least specific. For example, check >= 90 before >= 60. If you check >= 60 first, a score of 95 would match that condition and never reach the >= 90 check."
            },

            // Section 4: switch-case (Questions 10-13)
            {
                id: 10,
                question: "What is the purpose of the break statement in a switch-case?",
                options: [
                    "To start the switch",
                    "To exit the switch and prevent fall-through",
                    "To check the next case",
                    "To declare variables"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "break exits the switch statement immediately, preventing fall-through to the next case. Without break, execution continues to the next case even if it doesn't match, which is usually unintended."
            },
            {
                id: 11,
                question: "What will be printed? int day = 1; switch(day) { case 1: System.out.print('Mon'); case 2: System.out.print('Tue'); break; }",
                options: [
                    "Mon",
                    "Tue",
                    "MonTue",
                    "Nothing"
                ],
                answerIndex: 2,
                explanation: "MonTue will print due to fall-through. case 1 matches and prints 'Mon', but there's no break, so execution falls through to case 2, printing 'Tue', then breaks. This demonstrates why break is important!"
            },
            {
                id: 12,
                question: "When should you use switch-case instead of if-else?",
                options: [
                    "For range checks like age > 18",
                    "For checking exact constant values",
                    "For complex boolean conditions",
                    "switch and if-else are always interchangeable"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Use switch-case for checking a variable against multiple exact constant values (like 1, 2, 3 or 'A', 'B', 'C'). Use if-else for range checks, boolean conditions, or complex logic. switch is more efficient and readable for constant value checks."
            },
            {
                id: 13,
                question: "What is the purpose of the default case in a switch statement?",
                options: [
                    "It must be the first case",
                    "It handles values that don't match any case",
                    "It's mandatory in every switch",
                    "It repeats all cases"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "The default case handles values that don't match any other case. It's like the 'else' in if-else. While optional, it's good practice to include default for handling unexpected values."
            },

            // Section 5: for Loop (Questions 14-16)
            {
                id: 14,
                question: "What are the three parts of a for loop?",
                options: [
                    "start, stop, step",
                    "initialization, condition, update",
                    "begin, middle, end",
                    "declare, check, increment"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "A for loop has three parts: initialization (runs once at start), condition (checked before each iteration), and update (runs after each iteration). Example: for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)"
            },
            {
                id: 15,
                question: "How many times will this loop execute? for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)",
                options: [
                    "4 times",
                    "5 times",
                    "6 times",
                    "Infinite times"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "The loop executes 5 times (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). It starts at 1, continues while i <= 5, and increments by 1 each time. When i becomes 6, the condition i <= 5 is false, so the loop stops."
            },
            {
                id: 16,
                question: "What will be printed? for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) { System.out.print(i + ' '); }",

                    "0 1 2 3",
                    "1 2"
                ],
                answerIndex: 0,
                explanation: "0 1 2 will be printed. The loop starts at 0, continues while i < 3 (so 0, 1, 2), and prints each value. When i becomes 3, the condition i < 3 is false, so the loop stops."
            },

            // Section 6: while Loop (Questions 17-19)
            {
                id: 17,
                question: "What is the key difference between for and while loops?",
                options: [
                    "for is faster than while",
                    "for is used when iteration count is known, while for unknown count",
                    "while cannot use break",
                    "for can only count up"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Use for when you know exactly how many iterations (like looping through an array). Use while when the iteration count depends on a condition (like reading user input until they enter 'quit'). Both can achieve the same results, but one is more natural for each scenario."

                explanation: "The most common mistake is forgetting to update the loop variable inside the loop body. This causes an infinite loop because the condition never becomes false. Example: int i = 0; while (i < 5) { print(i); } // forgot i++!"
