                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Keywords are reserved words that have predefined, special meanings in Java. They cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, method names, etc.) and form the fundamental syntax of the language."

                    "No, it will cause a compilation error",
                    "Yes, but only in methods"
                ],
                answerIndex: 2,
                explanation: "Keywords are reserved and cannot be used as identifiers. Attempting to use a keyword as a variable name (e.g., int class = 5;) will result in a compilation error."
            },
            {

                answerIndex: 2,
                explanation: "String is a class name, not a keyword. Keywords include static, final, abstract, etc. String starts with uppercase because it's a class, while keywords are always lowercase."

                ],
                answerIndex: 3,
                explanation: "public provides the widest accessibility - members can be accessed from anywhere (any class, any package). The order from most to least restrictive is: private → default → protected → public."
            },
            {
                id: 5,

                    "Everywhere"
                ],
                answerIndex: 0,
                explanation: "private members are only accessible within the same class. This is the most restrictive access level and is used for encapsulation to hide internal implementation details."
            },
            {
                id: 6,
                question: "Which access modifier allows access in the same package and subclasses?",

                    "public",
                    "private",

                    "default"
                ],
                answerIndex: 2,
                explanation: "protected allows access within the same package AND in subclasses (even if they're in different packages). It's commonly used for members that should be accessible to child classes."
            },
            {
                id: 7,
                question: "What is the default access modifier if none is specified?",

                    "public",
                    "private",

                    "package-private (default)"
                ],
                answerIndex: 3,
                explanation: "If no access modifier is specified, the default is package-private (also called default access). Members are accessible only within the same package, not from other packages."
            },

            // Section 3: Non-Access Modifiers (Questions 8-13)
            {
                id: 8,
                question: "What does the static keyword indicate?",
                options: [
                    "Variable cannot be changed",
                    "Member belongs to the class, not instances",
                    "Method cannot be overridden",
                    "Class cannot be instantiated"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "static means the member belongs to the class itself, not to individual objects. Static members are shared across all instances and can be accessed without creating an object."
            },
            {
                id: 9,
                question: "What does the final keyword do when applied to a variable?",
                options: [
                    "Makes it accessible everywhere",
                    "Makes it a constant (cannot be reassigned)",
                    "Makes it thread-safe",
                    "Makes it private"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "final makes a variable a constant - once assigned, it cannot be reassigned. For reference types, the reference cannot change, but the object itself can still be modified."
            },
            {
                id: 10,
                question: "Can you create an instance of an abstract class?",
                options: [
                    "Yes, using the new keyword",
                    "Yes, but only in the same package",
                    "No, abstract classes cannot be instantiated",
                    "Yes, if it has a constructor"
                ],
                answerIndex: 2,
                explanation: "Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly. They serve as templates for concrete subclasses. You must create an instance of a concrete subclass that implements all abstract methods."
            },
            {
                id: 11,
                question: "What is the purpose of the synchronized keyword?",
                options: [
                    "To make code run faster",
                    "To ensure thread safety by allowing only one thread at a time",
                    "To synchronize with database",
                    "To make methods static"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "synchronized ensures thread safety by allowing only one thread to execute a method/block at a time. This prevents race conditions when multiple threads access shared resources."
            },
            {
                id: 12,
                question: "What does the volatile keyword ensure?",
                options: [
                    "Variable cannot be changed",
                    "Variable is thread-safe for all operations",
                    "Variable changes are visible to all threads immediately",
                    "Variable is stored on heap"
                ],
                answerIndex: 2,
                explanation: "volatile ensures that variable reads/writes go directly to main memory, making changes visible to all threads immediately. However, it doesn't guarantee atomicity for compound operations."
            },
            {
                id: 13,
                question: "Which combination of modifiers is INVALID?",
                options: [
                    "public static final",
                    "private final",
                    "abstract final",
                    "public static"
                ],
                answerIndex: 2,
                explanation: "abstract final is invalid because they contradict each other. abstract requires subclasses to override, while final prevents overriding. This combination makes no logical sense."
            },

            // Section 4: Control Flow (Questions 14-17)
            {
                id: 14,
                question: "What is the difference between break and continue?",
                options: [
                    "break exits the loop, continue skips current iteration",
                    "break skips iteration, continue exits loop",
                    "They are the same",
                    "break is for loops, continue is for switch"
                ],
                answerIndex: 0,
                explanation: "break exits the entire loop immediately. continue skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. break stops the loop, continue just skips one iteration."
            },
            {
                id: 15,
                question: "Can you use break outside of a loop or switch statement?",
                options: [
                    "Yes, anywhere in a method",
                    "Yes, but only in if statements",
                    "No, it will cause a compilation error",
                    "Yes, but only in static methods"
                ],
                answerIndex: 2,
                explanation: "break can only be used inside loops (for, while, do-while) or switch statements. Using it elsewhere causes a compilation error: 'break outside switch or loop'."
            },
            {
                id: 16,
                question: "What does the return keyword do?",
                options: [
                    "Exits the current loop",
                    "Skips to next iteration",
                    "Exits the method and optionally returns a value",
                    "Restarts the method"
                ],
                answerIndex: 2,
                explanation: "return exits the entire method immediately and optionally returns a value to the caller. For void methods, use 'return;' without a value. For non-void methods, return the appropriate type."
            },
            {
                id: 17,
                question: "In a switch statement, what happens if you omit the break keyword?",
                options: [
                    "Compilation error",
                    "Fall-through occurs (executes next cases)",
                    "Switch exits automatically",
                    "Runtime exception"
                ],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Without break, fall-through occurs - execution continues to the next case even if it doesn't match. This is sometimes intentional but often a bug. Always use break unless you specifically want fall-through."
            },

            // Section 5: Class and Object Keywords (Questions 18-22)
            {

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "this refers to the current object instance. It's used to distinguish instance variables from parameters, call other constructors, enable method chaining, and pass the current object as a parameter."
