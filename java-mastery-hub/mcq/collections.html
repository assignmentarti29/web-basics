                answerIndex: 2,

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "TreeMap does NOT allow null keys (in standard implementations) because it needs to compare keys for sorting, and comparing null throws NullPointerException."

                options: ["List.sort()", "Collections.sort()", "Arrays.sort()", "Collection.sort()"],
                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Collections.sort() is the standard utility method to sort a List. (List.sort() was added in Java 8 as an instance method too, but Collections.sort is the classic answer)."

                options: ["Comparable is external, Comparator is internal", "Comparable uses compare(), Comparator uses compareTo()", "Comparable defines natural ordering, Comparator defines custom ordering", "There is no difference"],
                answerIndex: 2,
                explanation: "Comparable is implemented by the class itself (natural ordering) using compareTo(). Comparator is a separate class/interface for custom ordering using compare()."

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "The default load factor is 0.75, meaning the map resizes when it is 75% full."

                answerIndex: 1,
                explanation: "Stack is the classic LIFO data structure. (Though ArrayDeque is often recommended as a modern replacement)."

                answerIndex: 1,

                answerIndex: 3,
                explanation: "All options are valid. Vector is legacy synchronized. Collections.synchronizedList() wraps it. CopyOnWriteArrayList is a concurrent alternative."

                answerIndex: 0,
                explanation: "It inserts 'A' at index 1. 'B' is at 0. So 'A' goes between 'B' and 'C'. Result: ['B', 'A', 'C']."
